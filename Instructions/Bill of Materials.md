# Bill of Materials
* Arduino of choice (This build uses the arduino nano v3)
* Ball screw linear actuator
  * 100mm Travel Length Linear Stage Actuator DIY CNC Router Parts X Y Z Linear Rail Guide Sfu1402 Nema17 by MySweety

  * If this is no longer being manufactured, another one with a Nema 17 stepper motor will work. You will need to adjust the 3D printed parts accordingly.
  * I will include a schematic of the linear actuator
* Polulu A4988 stepper driver

* USB cable to connect to arduino
* 12 V power supply
* Limit switch end stop

  * I may add a version that is syringe agnostic, depending on my needs. 
* 4 M5 screws
* 2 M2 screws
# Tools required
* Soldering iron and solder
* Access to a 3D printer
* Metric hex wrenches
